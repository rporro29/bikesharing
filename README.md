# Summary
## Based on the Analysis, most of the bike-sharing customers are subscribers. The highest usage areas were inside the city, not the suburb. We need to study the population density of Des Moines. This way, we can place the bikes in the best area for our future customers. I also recommend looking into how much the maintenance cost involves the bikes and the stations, as this will provide us with a better look into the business's profit.
